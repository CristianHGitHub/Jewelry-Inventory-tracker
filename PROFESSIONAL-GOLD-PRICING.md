# üèÜ Professional Gold Pricing System

## Overview

Your jewelry inventory tracker now features a **professional-grade gold pricing system** that accurately calculates gold values based on real market prices, purity percentages, and realistic dealer markup rates. This system provides the same calculations that professional jewelry dealers use.

## üéØ What Changed

### **‚ùå Old System (Incorrect)**

- **Simple Calculation**: Weight √ó Gold Price per Gram
- **No Purity Consideration**: Treated all gold as 100% pure
- **Unrealistic Values**: Showed inflated prices that don't reflect reality
- **No Dealer Markup**: Ignored what dealers actually pay

### **‚úÖ New System (Professional)**

- **Purity-Based Calculation**: Accounts for actual gold content
- **Real Market Prices**: Uses live gold price APIs
- **Dealer Markup**: Shows what dealers actually pay
- **Professional Accuracy**: Same calculations used by jewelry professionals

## üí∞ How Gold Pricing Actually Works

### **Market Price vs. Dealer Price**

```
Market Price: $3,355.30 per troy ounce (24K pure gold)
‚Üì
Price per Gram: $107.85 per gram (24K pure gold)
‚Üì
14K Gold (58.3% pure): $62.87 per gram of pure gold content
‚Üì
Dealer Pays: 75% of market value = $47.15 per gram
‚Üì
Dealer Markup: 25% (processing costs + profit)
```

### **Real-World Example**

- **Item**: 14K gold ring weighing 5.2 grams
- **Pure Gold Content**: 5.2g √ó 58.3% = 3.03 grams of pure gold
- **Market Value**: 3.03g √ó $107.85 = $326.79
- **Dealer Pays**: $326.79 √ó 75% = **$245.09**
- **Your Profit**: Sale price - $245.09

## üèÜ Gold Purity Standards

### **Karat System**

| Karat   | Purity % | Dealer Pays | Markup % | Example: 1g Value |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| **9K**  | 37.5%    | 65%         | 35%      | $26.29            |
| **10K** | 41.7%    | 70%         | 30%      | $31.47            |
| **14K** | 58.3%    | 75%         | 25%      | $47.15            |
| **18K** | 75.0%    | 80%         | 20%      | $64.68            |
| **22K** | 91.7%    | 85%         | 15%      | $84.18            |
| **24K** | 99.9%    | 90%         | 10%      | $97.07            |

### **Why Different Markups?**

- **Lower Karat (9K-14K)**: More alloy metals, harder to process
- **Higher Karat (18K-24K)**: Purer gold, easier to process
- **Processing Costs**: Melting, refining, testing, transportation
- **Market Risk**: Gold price fluctuations during processing
