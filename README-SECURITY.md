## 🚫 GitHub Safety

### **What's Excluded from GitHub**

- **Real Business Data**: All actual inventory and sales
- **Encrypted Files**: `.enc` files containing real data
- **Encryption Keys**: Your unique machine-specific keys
- **Backup Files**: Encrypted backup data
- **User Data**: Any personal or business information

### **What's Safe for GitHub**

- **Example Data**: Sample inventory, sales, and settings
- **Application Code**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server code
- **Documentation**: README files and instructions
- **Configuration**: Package files and dependencies

### **GitHub Protection**

```bash
# .gitignore ensures these are NEVER committed:
data/*.enc                  # Encrypted data files
data/.encryption_key       # Your encryption key
data/backups/              # Backup files
data/user_*.json           # User-specific data
```

## 💾 Data Management

### **Automatic Backups**

- **Frequency**: Configurable (daily/weekly/monthly)
- **Location**: `data/backups/` folder
- **Encryption**: All backups are encrypted
- **Retention**: Unlimited backup history

### **Data Export**

- **Format**: JSON with all your data
- **Encryption**: Exported data is NOT encrypted
- **Use Case**: Transfer to other systems, accounting software
- **Security**: Export only when needed

### **Data Wiping**

- **Complete Removal**: Permanently delete all data
- **Secure Deletion**: Overwrite with random data before deletion
- **Confirmation**: Type exact phrase to confirm
- **Irreversible**: Cannot be undone

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Encryption Process**

1. **Key Generation**: Unique key based on machine characteristics
2. **Salt Generation**: Random 64-byte salt for each encryption
3. **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
4. **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with random IV
5. **Authentication**: GCM tag for data integrity
6. **Storage**: Encrypted data with metadata

### **Security Measures**

- **Random IVs**: Each encryption uses unique initialization vector
- **Salt Protection**: Prevents rainbow table attacks
- **Key Stretching**: PBKDF2 makes brute force attacks impractical
- **Authentication**: GCM ensures data hasn't been tampered with
- **AAD Protection**: Additional data integrity verification

### **Performance**

- **Encryption Speed**: ~1MB/second on modern hardware
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead
- **Storage**: ~10% size increase due to metadata
- **Backup Speed**: Automatic background processing

## 🚨 Security Warnings

### **Important Notes**

- **Key Loss**: If you lose your encryption key, data cannot be recovered
- **Machine Change**: Data encrypted on one computer cannot be read on another
- **Backup Security**: Keep backup files secure - they contain your data
- **Physical Access**: Anyone with physical access to your computer can access data

### **Best Practices**

1. **Regular Backups**: Use the backup feature frequently
2. **Secure Storage**: Keep backup files in a safe location
3. **Key Protection**: Don't delete the `.encryption_key` file
4. **Access Control**: Use strong computer passwords
5. **Virus Protection**: Keep your computer secure from malware

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **"Failed to decrypt data" Error**

- **Cause**: Encryption key mismatch or corrupted data
- **Solution**: Check if you're on the same computer, restore from backup
